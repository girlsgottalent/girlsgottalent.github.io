<p>The two  rectangles on the left are the same color as the two small rectangles on the right. What's the difference? A dark background makes your eyes think the rectangle is lighter, and a light background makes your eyes think the rectangle is darker. It's called the "brightness contrast illusion."</p>

<p>The green and red tables are actually the same shape. So why does the green table look longer than the red table? Your brain looks at the angles on the green table and, based on past experience, thinks it's longer just because the steeper angles mean more depth. The right picture shows that the dimensions of the tables are in fact identical. Sorry, no fancy name - this is just the "table illusion."</p>

<h3> What they used:</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cup 1:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>water (H2O)</li>
<li>starch packet</li>
<li>citric acid (C6H8O7)</li>
<li>sodium sulfite (Na2SO3)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cup 2:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>water (H2O)</li>
<li>sodium iodate (NaIO3)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What's happening:</h3>
<p>The starch packet and citric acid are in battle. At first, when the two cups are mixed, the sodium sulfite and sodium iodate work together to make iodine. The starch is trying to turn iodine blue, but citric acid keeps it clear. Eventually the citric acid runs out and the mixture turns blue!</p>
