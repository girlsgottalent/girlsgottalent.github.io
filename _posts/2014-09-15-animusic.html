<p>Animusic combines two of my favorite subjects: computer science and music. The creators built virtual instruments inside a computer, which they can then program to play anything they want. It's cool because this isn't just a video - the programmers actually gave the virtual instruments instructions to play certain pieces. And once they built the instruments for one project, then can give those same instruments a different piece to play!</p>
<p>This video shows bits and pieces of the instruments in progress with the final music playing the background. You can see how the programmers put everything together step by step - first using what looks like holograms, then black and white solid shapes, then finally the full color virtual instruments. </p>

<p>Last year I read about some scientists in Spain teaching a computer to compose music. They told the computer what any particular instrument can and cannot do, taught the computer some basic music theory, and let it run. The user can tell the computer which instruments to use or how long the piece should be, but otherwise the computer creates the music! Seems like the results still don't quite sound like a human wrote it, but it sounds pretty good already.</p>

<p>If any of you are music aficionados, maybe you don't have to give up music to pursue science! I love to see projects like this, where science is combined with something completely different. But this Animusic is only a new creature. Personally I don't think it's good enough yet to deliver the heart-felt music that musicians can make. Nevertheless, it is an exciting start, isn't it? Can't wait to see what amazing projects you all build!</p>
