<p>The green thing that looks like a music note is a <b>Purkinje neuron</b>, a nerve cell in the brain. This particular cell acts as a messenger, sending tiny chemical packages between immune cells and other types of neurons when we're sick. Here the cell was told to make green fluorescent protein - giving it that beautiful green glow.</p>
