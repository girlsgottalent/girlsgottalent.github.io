<p style="text-align: center">Some 2.5 million rivets and 60 metric tons of paint help keep this mighty icon of Paris strong and beautiful.</p>

<p>Whether you're French or not, the Eiffel Tower is an icon admired worldwide. It turns out there's a lot of science that went into building the tower and making it such a unique structure - here are a few!</p>
<ol>
<li>The pillars at the bottom of the tower curve in at 54° - the angle minimizes wind resistance.</li>
<li>Each year, the Tower’s elevators travel a total of 2.5 trips around the world, or more than 64,000 miles.</li>
<li>To keep it from rusting, the Tower is repainted with 60 metric tons of paint every 7 years.</li>
<li>Winds can cause the top of the Tower to sway, side-to-side, by up to 7 centimeters (2.8 inches). But no worries, it's not as bad as the Leaning Tower of Pisa!</li>
</ol>

<p>It's almost unthinkable to imagine Paris without the Eiffel Tower, but that's almost what happened. The Tower was only supposed to last 20 years according to its creator, Gustave Eiffel. In fact, people heavily criticized the Tower during the Paris World Fair of 1889. But Eiffel turned his Tower into a center for research (for purposes like wind experiments) in Paris and saved his iconic building.
