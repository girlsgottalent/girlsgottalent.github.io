<p style="text-align: center">Some 2.5 million rivets and 60 metric tons of paint help keep this mighty icon of Paris strong and beautiful.</p>

<p>Whether you're French or not, the Eiffel Tower is an icon admired worldwide. It turns out there's a lot of science that went into building the tower and making it such a unique structure - here are a few!</p>
<ol>
<li>The pillars at the bottom of the tower curve in at 54° - the angle minimizes wind resistance.</li>
<li>Each year, the Tower’s elevators travel a total of 2.5 trips around the world, or more than 64,000 miles.</li>
<li>To keep it from rusting, the Tower is repainted with 60 metric tons of paint every 7 years.</li>
<li>Winds can cause the top of the Tower to sway, side-to-side, by up to 7 centimeters (2.8 inches). But no worries, it's not as bad as the Leaning Tower of Pisa!</li>

In fact, people heavily criticized the Tower during the Paris World Fair of 1889. But Eiffel turned his Tower into a center for research (for purposes like wind experiments) in Paris and saved his iconic building.
