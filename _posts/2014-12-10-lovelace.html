<p>Ada Lovelace, the world's first computer programmer, would have turned 199 years old today! She was born the daughter of a Romantic poet, which gave her the ability to appreciate the beauty of math. When she was asked to translate an analysis of what was considered an advanced "computer" at that time, she went above and beyond the call of duty and wrote a complete procedure to calculate a series of numbers. She accomplished this about 150 years before the first modern computer was built! An inspiration to girls pursuing STEM worldwide.</p>
