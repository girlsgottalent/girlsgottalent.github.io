<p><a href="http://canteengirl.org/exploreyourfuture/tours/about/">Tour Your Future</a>. How does that sound? It’s not another science fiction story. It’s actually a series of tours that you can physically go to. And yes, it’s as cool as in the science fictions, literally and figuratively. I went to my first one last Saturday with close to 20 other girls, from age 11 to 17, at Aquion Energy, located in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>As a startup company, Aquion has created amazing new technology in its labs, such as batteries that can store energy harvested from solar panels, completely environmental friendly. And yet, we discovered a room that had picnic tables on top of synthetic grass, all surrounded by wooden fences. Apparently, the scientists at Aquion like to take breaks from their lab work (in well-established research laboratories with all the fancy equipment you would expect) by coming to this picnic area and pretending that it's summer. Who said scientists couldn't have fun?</p>
<p>After touring the facilities, we had the chance to try our hands at electroplating, or coating one metal with another metal. We took small pieces of nickel metal, cleaned and drew designs on them, and then used a current generator to carry out the chemical reaction that plated copper metal onto our nickel metal jewelry pieces. Interestingly, while some pieces coated perfectly, others barely worked at all. That definitely felt familiar, like the countless times something unexpected happened in my own research. "What you have to know about science is that it doesn't always work," said one of the Aquion ladies. And when it doesn't, we simply try again.</p>
<p>At the end of the event, we enjoyed a cold treat – liquid nitrogen ice cream! – by mixing ingredients for ice cream together in a bowl and then freezing the solution with liquid nitrogen, which is about -350 degrees Fahrenheit. Super cold! Seeing the ice cream freeze so quickly brought significance to the numbers that I had only read about previously. In fact, all the hands-on experience made the trip especially exciting.</p>
<p>As our tour guide said, "Science can be hard...but it's just so much fun!" I already can't wait for the event next Saturday!</p>
