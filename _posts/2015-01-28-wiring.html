<p>Last week I was lucky enough to meet 2 groups of ladies, both of whom work with wires but in different ways.</p>
<p>The first was Eaton Corporation, a group of electrical engineers who manage power for companies like Facebook and Boeing – yes, they control your everyday life from invisible network to gigantic airplane! Ever wonder how social media sites are up and running 24/7? Eaton figures out how to keep their servers on constantly! I toured Eaton's Power Systems Experience Center through Carnegie Science Center's <a href="http://canteengirl.org/exploreyourfuture/tours/about/">Tour Your Future</a> program and saw what they called UPS: Uninterruptible Power Supply. Unlike the package delivery company that uses trucks, these UPS systems store energy in their internal batteries, which they can use to supply power to an appliance - like your fridge, or Facebook's server - when the power goes out during an emergency. Some of the bigger UPS's can do this almost instantaneously, which is why Facebook almost never goes down!</p>
<p>After learning about some of the technologies that Eaton builds, we had the chance to wire our own sample outlet to a breaker box, just like the one you would have in your house. With some basic instructions and a box of parts and tools, we worked in teams to connect the wires to the right places. Creating a wiring system is like generating a maze, and making a light bulb light up by building the actual outlet where it's plugged in is simply amazing!</p>

<p>The second was a group of ladies from Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science, part of the Roadshow program hosted by Women@SCS (the women in computer science club at CMU). The interactive presentation they gave us included lots of fun and funny demos. One of them involved figuring out how many steps it takes to get from STUDENT to SCIENTIST, when you can only add, remove, or replace letters. Another involved "programming" a "robot" - one of the presenters - to put on a scarf. The robot only understood very very basic commands, so we in the audience had to tell the robot things like "open hand" and "move arm up" to help it put on the scarf - an action that we as humans think of as very simple, but to a computer it's not so easy. The experience of breaking down a problem (in this case, putting on a scarf) into its most basic parts was a really interesting insight into how programming and computers work.</p>
<p>These girls were students at one of the best computer science schools in the world, and yet they talked like any of us would. They got tongue-tied and laughed it off. They talked about why and what parts of computer science they found interesting, and their eyes lit up. One of the girls talked about how scientists were able to control parts of the brain using electrical signals - "so we can do mind control! And I think that's really cool." I loved seeing these girls talk about what they love; their enthusiasm inspired me to keep pursuing my own passions.</p>
<p>By the way, it takes 6 steps to turn STUDENT --> SCIENTIST:<br />
0. STUDENT<br />
1. SCUDENT<br />
2. SCIDENT<br />
3. SCIENT<br />
4. SCIENTI<br />
5. SCIENTIS<br />
6. SCIENTIST</p>
