<p>This is a <b>supercell storm</b> in Julesburg, Colorado. Amazingly enough, it was "tornado warned for more than one hour, but it stayed an LP [low precipitation] storm through all its cycles and never produced a tornado, just occasional brief funnels, large hail, and some rain." To think that something so vast never became a full-blown tornado!</p>
