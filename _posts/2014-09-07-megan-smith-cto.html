<p>Woohoo! President Obama just appointed Google's former vice president Megan Smith as his new Chief Technical Officer (CTO). What does that fancy title mean? Ms. Smith is now trying to solve science and technological issues for the entire United States. For comparison, the previous CTO largely fixed HealthCare.gov when it had issues late last year.</p>
<p>So who is Megan Smith? She was just the leader of many Google projects including Picasa, Google Maps, and Google Earth. Ms. Smith was also a member of the Google[x] team, which was responsible for making Google Glass, the driverless car, and other cutting-edge technologies. Before that, she worked at various startups like Apple in Tokyo. And even before that, she built and drove a solar car across the Australian Outback in the very first Cross-Continental Solar Car race with fellow MIT students. She's been making history for a long time!</p>
<p>Now that Megan Smith has such an important job in the government itself, how will American technology change? Nobody is sure what exactly will happen in the next few months and years, but based on Smith's previous experience, it looks like exciting changes are about to come. Besides the physical changes in our government--promised to be modernized to keep up with the now tech-dominated world through the U.S. Digital Service unit--Megan Smith will be a hero for millions of young girls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b style="text-align: center;">We want to show you that you have incredible heroes who already do this work." -Megan Smith</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smith said herself at Google's <a href="https://www.madewithcode.com/" target="_blank">Made with Code</a> event this summer, girls and women need more heroes. According to Smith, “Nobody’s encouraging you. Nobody’s showing you the value of why you’re doing this and why it’s so impactful on the world...We want to show you that you have incredible heroes who already do this work."</p>
<p>The United States government now has a woman tech hero onboard! Locally, our new Women in STEM Club at school (to be featured in a future article) is ready to reach for the stars! Will you be the next girl on Team Science?</p>
