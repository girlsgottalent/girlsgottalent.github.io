<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>That's the first thing I learned to say in Python. Exotic African language? Nah. Super cool and useful programming language? You bet!</p>
<p>I'll be spending 5 weeks at the Pennsylvania Governor's School for the Sciences (we'll call it PGSS) this summer. At PGSS, we take classes in all the different sciences and some electives. On top of that, we do a team research project. My project will be in computational chemistry - that's why I'm learning Python. I don't have all the details yet, but it looks like I'll be using computer algorithms (written in Python) to find new nanoparticles! Can't wait to meet my teammates and learn more!</p>
<p>Besides the science itself, I'm really looking forward to being in a place where everybody loves science as much as I do for 5 entire weeks. Normally I see all kinds of people in school - science people, yes, but also hard core punk rockers, violinists, avid readers, soccer players (<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">VIVA BRASIL</span>), you name it. Of my math and science friends, the vast majority are guys. While I'm perfectly happy with my friend group, I'm also excited to meet girls who actually like physics, despite the overwhelming stigma against female scientists. I'm sure these girls, like me, think that math isn't bad at all once you see how it relates to literally everything. Maybe that's the one advantage that guys have: they're drawn toward math and science naturally, so they get to see all the mysteries and magic of science before the girls realize that there's a whole world of possibilities!</p>
<p>I'm so glad you've read this far on my blog. There will be many more stories to come!</p>
<p>And, just for kicks: <a href="http://youtu.be/BgyJY9yndv4" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/BgyJY9yndv4</a> (because this is a beautiful song and, in my opinion, better than this year's FIFA theme song)</p>
