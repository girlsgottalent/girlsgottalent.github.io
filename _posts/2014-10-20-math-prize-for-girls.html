<p>I'm in an auditorium with about 270 other girls. They're laughing, chatting about the games they played on Friday night, and generally having a good time. Although they might only have met the night before, they're already becoming fast friends.</p>
<p>These girls, though, each have pencils and papers on the desks in front of them. Their answer sheets have 20 spaces, one for each of 20 problems they will solve. They're about to spend 2.5 hours solving math problems, simply because they love math.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to meet these girls at the Math Prize for Girls competition at MIT the weekend of September 27th. The best part wasn't the math itself; it was being in a place full of girls who are every bit as passionate about math as I am. For once, the line for the girls bathroom was longer than the one for the boys bathroom at a math competition! It seems insignificant, but this experience really made me feel welcome in a community of mathematicians. Not just the stereotypical male mathematician hunched over dusty papers, but women as valuable members of the math community.</p>
<p>We heard speeches from several women in math and science fields, with perspectives ranging from Math Prize alumnae to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Professor Dina Katabi. They're all working on fascinating research in math and science, but the most inspiring part of that afternoon was hearing the passion in all of their voices--seeing their love for math and science and their heartfelt encouragement to all of us girls. If Professor Katabi, wearing knee-high cowgirl boots, can do computer science, then so can I!</p>
