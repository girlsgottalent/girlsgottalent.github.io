<p>They say you never know what you have until you lose it.</p>
<p>Until today, I never knew how much Governor's School would impact my life. It hit at the most random time: when we sang goodbye to one of our classmates. I don't know why I burst into tears then and not at some other time. Maybe it was because I had stayed up almost all night hanging on to those last moments with my classmates, and the "good-bye" officially cut it off. All the moments had become memories, profoundly warm and special memories.</p>
<p>My chemistry teacher said that I saw what it's like to be a fish in the big pond this summer. He was right. At school, I'm just a small fish in a small pond - there's only so much I can do within a high school environment with limited classes, rules, and whatnot. At gov school, I'm living on my own in a real college dorm with a roommate, public bathrooms (in which you must wear shoes to the shower because you never know what has been on the floors), and people awake at odd hours. More importantly, I took classes from real college profs who metaphorically kicked my butt in those classes...I learned way way more about special relativity (see? you haven't even heard of it) than I ever wanted to! But the professor was hilarious so it was lots of fun.</p>
<p>At PGSS, I was one of 60 unique fish in the big pond of Carnegie Mellon University. I saw 60 different personalities and 60 different backgrounds transform into one class. I learned from every single one of my classmates and TAs when we talked about topics ranging from modern music to what they're working on in the lab. We worked together on countless problems past midnight, since nobody really knew how to operate JMol (an online modeling tool for biology) by themselves. How many Govies does it take to change a light bulb? Not sure, but I <i>can</i> tell you how many Govies it takes to make an experiment out of box fans, trash cans, and paper airplanes. (Answer: As many as will fit in the hall and stay awake.)</p>
<p>I also learned about myself. Here at PGSS, I fell in love with computer science (according to our CS prof, what I'm doing should really be called programming), in no small part because of the amazing people who patiently helped me debug my code and teach me tricks I needed to solve a particular problem. In doing problem sets, I discovered that I have the bad habit of staring at the paper for the longest time before finally going to ask for help. Ironically, now I am absolutely happy to admit that I need help from others who are better than me in some subject - I do have my strengths (chem), but it's a really good thing that others had talents in physics. Life is a lot easier and fulfilling that way.</p>
<p>So most importantly, I made 59 (not counting TAs) new best friends. You might even say I gained 59 new brothers and sisters, because honestly that's how close I feel to them after only five weeks. We share a common love of science, and over the course of five weeks channeled our passions into the most intense experience we've ever had. Through the difficulties we built comraderie, and by the end we'd gotten to know each other so well that none of us wanted to leave. High school just won't be the same after this.</p>
<p>If any of you Govies are reading this, I love you. If any high school juniors in Pennsylvania are reading this, <a href="http://sciences.pa-gov-schools.org/selection_process" target="_blank">APPLY TO PGSS 2015</a>!! If you get in, you will have an absolute blast. Everyone else...science camp, or nerd camp, was the best time of my life. Everyone was so kind, imaginative, and personable. All of the students were great at science, but all were also great people. Not all scientists are mad =)</p>
