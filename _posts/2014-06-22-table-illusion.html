<p>The green and red tables are actually the same shape. So why does the green table look longer than the red table? Your brain looks at the angles on the green table and, based on past experience, thinks it's longer just because the steeper angles mean more depth. The right picture shows that the dimensions of the tables are in fact identical. Sorry, no fancy name - this is just the "table illusion."</p>
