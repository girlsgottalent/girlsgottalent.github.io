<p>I received a picture of a little girl sitting in front of the computer, eyes glued to the cute little coding blocks on the screen. This beautiful 6-year-old ballerina explored my website with her mom, discovered <a href="http://www.code.org" target="_blank">Code.org</a> from my <a href="http://www.girlsgottalent.org/links/" target="_blank">Links</a> page, and now has become a young fan of coding! Who says girls don’t code? The little girl’s mother said with profound pride, “I’m going to have a coding ballerina!”</p>
<p>I was so thrilled when I saw the picture and heard what happened. “Awesome!!!” I said to myself - this is the best achievement and the most gratifying moment I’ve ever had! Sharing my passion and opening the door to science for young students have been truly worthwhile.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, as I was reading a New York Times op-ed, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/opinion/sunday/how-to-get-girls-into-coding.html" target="_blank">How to Get Girls Into Coding</a>, a seventh grader’s plain words echoed in my head: “I was one of two girls in the class. We kind of had to fend for ourselves.” How familiar <i>that</i> sounds! I hope what I’m doing now can be little steps of a big movement, making it easier for girls to get involved in STEM fields. No plaque or medal is as rewarding as making other people’s lives easier and happier. Looking forward to seeing more and more coding ballerinas!</p>
<p>Happy <span style="color: #ff0000;">World</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Cup</span> everyone!</p>
