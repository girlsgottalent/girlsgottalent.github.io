<p>What happens when you tell a little girl that she's pretty?</p>
<p>It's a compliment! "Who's my pretty girl?" Sure. Girls are stunningly beautiful, maybe even more so with a little bit of makeup! :) What happens then, as shown in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/24/verizon-ad-tells-parents-to-encourage-girls_n_5526236.html" target="_blank">this powerful video</a>, when a girl hears things like “Don’t get your dress dirty" and "You don't want to mess with that"? She slowly drifts away from exploring the amazing world. :(</p>
<p>In the video, a girl starts out wandering and exploring everything around her – flowers, rocks, starfish on the beach – but her parents tell her that she's pretty and that she shouldn't get her clothes dirty when she's playing. Instead, they tell her to give the tool to her brother. So as she grows up, even though she wants to build rockets and do other cool experiments, she's told to let the boys do it.</p>
<p>Traditionally people, regardless of their backgrounds, think boys are better at that kind of thing. However, the National Girls Collaborative Project reported that girls and boys in in kindergarten through 12th grade “do not significantly differ in their abilities in mathematics and science, but they do differ in their interest and confidence in STEM subjects.” You got it - girls and boys are on an even playing field till you think about how people react to them. It’s all in the mind! I don’t deny that the brains of girls and boys may wire differently, but at least give everyone a fair chance to do it themselves.</p>
<p>Girls, ask your mom with your charming smile: “May I put on my work clothes? I’ll change into my nice dress later."</p>
<p>Parents and teachers, it’s time to tell her she’s pretty brilliant. Yes, pretty and brilliant. Beauty and Brains!</p>
