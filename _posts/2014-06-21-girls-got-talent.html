<p>There are some brilliant girls out there. Mayim Bialik is well known as Amy on the Big Bang Theory. But she also <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/04/showbiz/gallery/celebs-with-advanced-degrees/" target="_blank">triple majored in Hebrew, Jewish studies, and neuroscience</a> - and got her PhD in neuroscience - at UCLA. Marian Bechtel thought of a way to <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/04/18/marian-bechtel-landmine-acoustics/" target="_blank">detect land mines using sound waves</a> and vibrations. She got the idea while she was playing piano. Ann Makosinski created a <a href="http://youtu.be/yrnNmzSSn0w" target="_blank">flashlight that runs just using the heat of the human hand</a>. Valerie Ding is also a groundbreaking researcher, but on top of that she's an amazing pianist. You can hear her play the Schumann Piano Concerto starting at <a href="http://www.allclassical.org/on-deck/on-deck-with-valerie-ding/" target="_blank">7:50 of this recording</a> (scroll down after you click on the link). So beautiful!!</p>
<p>I’m incredibly excited about the possibilities that girls have in the 21st century – for everything from <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/secretlife/entertainment/mayim-bialik/" target="_blank">acting as Amy on the Big Bang Theory</a> to <a href="http://leanin.org/stories/marissa-mayer/" target="_blank">being the CEO of Yahoo!</a> The truth is, a lot of people still think science is hard or “not for me.” Especially for girls, science is intimidating. We’re surrounded by future mad scientists and nerdy guys. I can relate – there are only two girls in my science class this year. But I think that science is something that we can all relate to, something that surrounds us and that is actually wildly interesting.</p>
<p>Science isn’t just for particle physicists at high-end jobs. Science is in lip gloss, sunscreen, and that perfect Snapchat photo. Science is in your favorite homemade brownies. Science is in the computer, tablet, or smartphone you’re using to check out this blog. We don’t all have to be Einsteins; we can design waterproof mascara that’s actually waterproof, or something along those lines. I want to show you that science is fun!</p>
