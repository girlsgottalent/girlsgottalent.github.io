<p>This <b>fire rainbow</b> formed when light from the Sun, which was at least 58 degrees above the horizon, passed through ice crystals in the clouds. The sunlight hit the top of the crystals and was split into a rainbow of colors - the same way that sunlight might create a rainbow on your wall if it passes through your chandelier.</p>
