<p>I decided to get creative and personal for this one. I play piano, so I took one of my piano recordings and opened it in an audio editing program called Audacity. Then I zoomed in on the music, and here are the (I think they're awesome) results:</p>
<p>The full recording:
<img class="size-full wp-image-492" src={{ site.baseurl }}"/assets/cropFull.png" alt="The entire 6-minute recording" width="1145" height="254" /></p>

<p>Half of the recording:
<img class="size-full wp-image-493" src={{ site.baseurl }}"/assets/cropHalf.png" alt="Half of the recording" width="1161" height="254" /></p>

<p>Two seconds of the recording:
<img class="size-full wp-image-494" src={{ site.baseurl }}"/assets/cropTwo.png" alt="Two seconds of the recording" width="1158" height="252" /></p>

<p>A fraction of a second of the recording:
<img class="size-full wp-image-495" src={{ site.baseurl }}"/assets/cropWaves.png" alt="The recording zoomed in a lot" width="1161" height="258" /></p>

<p>In the last picture, you can see the individual waves of sound. A little bit of backstory: sound exists as waves, shaped like ocean waves but made up of, well, sound! They vary in several different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>How tall they are means how loud they are</li>
<li>How close together they are means how high the pitch is (closer = higher pitch)</li>
<li>There are other things like sound pressure that we can't see from the graph alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond that, different instruments look different when they're graphed, and even different pianos or different violins or certainly different voices look different!</p>
<p>If you want to learn even more about sound, <a href="http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/musicandcomputers/chapter1/01_01.php">Columbia University</a> has a nice tutorial on the basic physics of sound and some more examples of different sounds and their graphs.</p>
