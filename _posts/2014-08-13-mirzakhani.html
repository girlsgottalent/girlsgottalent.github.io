<p>Power women are on the rise! Dr. Maryam Mirzakhani, a math professor at Stanford, became the first woman to win the Fields Medal, considered the "Nobel Prize of mathematics." What an inspiring and yet humble human being she is! Her quotes speak for themselves.</p>
<p>On the Fields Medal: “This is a great honor. I will be happy if it encourages young female scientists and mathematicians.”</p>
<p>On math itself: "I don’t think that everyone should become a mathematician, but I do believe that many students don’t give mathematics a real chance. <b>I did poorly in math for a couple of years in middle school</b>; I was just not interested in thinking about it. I can see that without being excited mathematics can look pointless and cold. <b>The beauty of mathematics only shows itself to more patient followers</b>."</p>
<p>Some good articles on Dr. Mirzakhani:<br />
