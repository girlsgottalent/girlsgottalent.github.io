<p>So precious! Cooper has been born deaf and hears his mom talking for the first time ever in his life. This was made a reality because Cooper got <a href="http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/pages/coch.aspx">cochlear implants</a>, which bypasses the damaged ear and transmits sounds electronically to the auditory nerve itself. The brain can still process sounds, and it feels like you're hearing!</p>
