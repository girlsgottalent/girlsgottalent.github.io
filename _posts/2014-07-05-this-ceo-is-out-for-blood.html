<p>What? OMG! The title is daunting. But after you read <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/" target="_blank">this article on Fortune</a>, you will realize - OK, this isn't as violent as it sounds. Instead, it's fascinating!</p>
<p>Elizabeth Holmes is stunningly beautiful (unfairly so! See her picture below) and amazingly brilliant. When she was a college sophomore, she invented a wearable skin patch that could give people medicine and radio your doctor what's going on in your blood in real time - then adjust the amount of medicine accordingly. Now, ten years later, she's the owner of <a href="http://www.theranos.com/" target="_blank">Theranos</a>, a company in the $73 billion diagnostic lab business, which may radically change our health care system. The company can do more blood tests using 100 times less blood than current tests need - at a 10th of the price!</p>

<p>This girl is the perfect image of Beauty and Brains, and exceptionally brave! If you haven't already heard about Theranos, wait another year or two and see what happens.</p>
