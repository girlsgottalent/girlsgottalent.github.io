<p>I'm three weeks into gov school, and I just had a life-changing lecture by an amazing computer science (CS) professor. Why life-changing? He showed us the roots of CS: how computers think at the most basic level. It was a completely new way of thinking, but Professor Kosbie made it make sense.</p>
<p>His personality was just funny. He really connected with us, talked like us, and made us feel like we were in the right place. He showed us graphs of the big computer companies' (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo, IBM) stocks and commentated - like Lee Jordan, the prankster from Harry Potter - on the peaks and drops of each company's history. (By the way, Microsoft saved Apple at one point - and now Apple is trumping Microsoft. Haha.) He manipulated numbers and turned subtraction into addition. He predicted how fast a certain calculation would take based on the mathy side of comp sci. He showed us card tricks that explained how certain error detection methods work. Things that you wouldn't expect are even remotely related to computer science, he explained in terms of computer science.</p>
<p>It was just incredibly cool. I always thought computer science was writing a bunch of code that looks like a foreign language (well, that's sometimes true), but Professor Kosbie showed us that computer science is really fascinating. True computer scientists, not to be confused with developers and pure programmers, think about the logic and reasoning behind why certain bits of code work, or how we can make them work. He told me that apparently, when big companies come up with some new idea for making a new product, sometimes they can't use existing algorithms to make that product. So they hire computer scientists to come up with new ways to actually code the stuff.</p>
<p>AND, you can connect CS to virtually any subject. A lot of new medicines were made because the Human Genome Project - run by computational biologists, with the help of supercomputers - allowed people to sequence every gene in the human body. Project ENCODE, its daughter project, is currently trying to catalog the function of all those genes. Hopefully, this computer science project will lead to even more medical advancements.</p>
<p>Other fields, too, are hugely impacted by computer science. Did you know that there's a new TV made from organic stuff? Computer science made it possible to make a new screen that is brighter than previous screens, has better color, is thinner, etc. from organic stuff. Plants and whatnot!</p>
<p>I think this story is testament to the fact that one really good teacher can make a huge difference. I hope everyone has the chance to learn from someone who is legitimately passionate about what he or she teaches. Professor Kosbie's love of computer science was infectious, and because of him I'm seriously considering doing something related to computer science for life. </p>
